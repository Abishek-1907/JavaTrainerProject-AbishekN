## Teaching Explanation

### 1. What is Dependency Injection?
Dependency Injection is when Spring automatically provides required dependencies (like services) into your classes. We use `@RequiredArgsConstructor` to inject services into controllers.

### 2. How did you implement Trainer Assignment?
We filter trainers by subject match, exclude overlapping batches, and pick the one with the best rating and lowest current workload. It's a greedy algorithm using sorting and filtering.

### 3. Why this Architecture?
The project uses a clean layered architecture: controller â†’ service â†’ repository â†’ model. Business logic and API layers are separated for clarity and testability.
